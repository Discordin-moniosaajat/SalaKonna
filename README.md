# SalaKonna

SalaKonna is a discord bot, with a purpose of allowing users to have conversations with each others while remaining anonymous under a pseudonym. 


And how it works for now (subject to change, as the project is still in progress): 

Once the bot is online and running on the discord server, write a slash command: /post, on a text channel. 

![slashCommand-Post](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98490914/199025682-e47bd0cb-4509-4f0e-bb77-c3e03098c59d.png)

Then write your message and send. 

![Message](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98490914/199026078-33b3fe77-4d08-4f95-abca-6f4f2f68c500.png)

The message will appear on another text channel under a pseudonym. (Currently the testing is done with a table of 6 colour pseudonyms.)

Also for moderation purposes the message will also be sent to a log. Where you can find the necessary information on: who sent what and when.
